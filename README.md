# Predictive-Customer-Lifetime-Value-Model-for-Dropbox

## Project Overview
  This project focuses on analyzing and understanding the behavior of customers using a SaaS subscription service. The goal is to extract actionable insights from customer data to improve retention, optimize customer support, and enhance overall customer experience. The project encompasses customer segmentation, churn rate analysis, usage pattern exploration, and predictive modeling of customer behavior.

## Data Summary
  
  **1. Customer Demographics:** The data includes various demographic attributes such as age, gender, location, occupation, and education level, which are used to segment and analyze customer behavior.

  **2. Subscription Data:** Details of subscription plans, payment methods, and revenue generated by each customer.

  **3. Usage Data:** Information on session durations, file count, storage used, share count, and device types used by customers.
  
  **4. Customer Support Data:** Data related to customer interactions, including interaction types, resolution times, and support channels.

  **5. Revenue Data:** Purchase amounts and types of products/services bought by customers.

## Technology Stack

  **Programming Language:** Python
  
  **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
  **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
  **Modeling:** Scikit-learn
  
  **Deployment:** Joblib for model serialization


## Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
  
## Key Features and Metrics
   **1. Customer Churn Analysis**

   **Churn Rate:** The churn rate is calculated as the percentage of customers who have canceled their subscriptions.

   **Churn Rate:** 9.38%

   The churn rate helps in understanding the proportion of customers leaving the service, which is crucial for retention strategies.
     
  **2. Session Duration Analysis**

   **Average Session Duration:** Measures the average time users spend in a session.

   **Average Session Duration:** 2067.84 seconds (~34.46 minutes)

   This metric indicates the engagement level of users with the service, which can be correlated with customer satisfaction and likelihood of churn.
  
  **3. Customer Support Efficiency**
  
   **Average Resolution Time:** Measures the average time taken to resolve customer issues.
  
   **Average Resolution Time:** 63.74 minutes

   Quick resolution of customer issues is vital for maintaining customer satisfaction and preventing churn.

  **4. Interaction Volume**

   **Total Interactions:** The number of customer interactions recorded.
  
   **Total Interactions:** 107,455

   This provides insights into the frequency and volume of customer interactions, helping to identify peak times and potential bottlenecks in support.

  **5. Revenue Segmentation**
  
   The customers are segmented based on their revenue contribution, which helps in tailoring specific marketing strategies.

   **Revenue Segments:**
  
   Low: Average subscription length: 5.83 months

   Medium: Average subscription length: 11.96 months

   High: Average subscription length: 14.69 months

   Very High: Average subscription length: 17.27 months
     
  **6. Predictive Modeling**
  
   A predictive model was developed to forecast customer behavior, specifically focusing on revenue generation and churn prediction.

   **Model Performance Metrics:**

   **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.4435265114088307

   **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 0.7108820187675142

   **R-squared (RÂ²):** 0.28308272555647596


## Future Work
  **Improvement of Predictive Model:** Further fine-tuning of the model with additional features and hyperparameter optimization.
  
  **Real-Time Integration:** Implement real-time data processing and analysis for immediate insights.
    
  **Enhanced Visualizations:** Develop interactive dashboards for better data exploration and presentation.


## Conclusion

  This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior within a SaaS subscription service, highlighting key metrics and insights that can drive business decisions to enhance customer retention and satisfaction.
